## 📜 What is TypeScript?  
**TypeScript** is a **strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language** that extends JavaScript. It helps developers write safer, more scalable, and maintainable code.  

✔️ **Static Typing** — Catches errors at compile-time instead of runtime.  
✔️ **Modern JavaScript Features** — Supports ES6+ features with great compatibility.  
✔️ **Interfaces & Generics** — Provides powerful abstractions for complex applications.  
✔️ **Better Tooling** — Works seamlessly with VS Code, ESLint, and other tools.
